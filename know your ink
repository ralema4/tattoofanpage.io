    <h1 id="F">The First Tattoos</h1>
    <p>An evidence that prehistoric big bois knew and practiced tattooing are tools that were discovered in France, Portugal, and Scandinavia. These tools are at least 12,000 years old and were used for tattooing. Dankest surviving tattoos are the ones found Ötzi the Iceman, mummy found in the Ötz valley in the Alps and dating from the 5th to 4th millennium BC.</p>
    <p>We also know that Germanic and Celtic tribes also tattooed themselves (wow such big bois!). Mummy of Amunet from ancient Egypt and the mummies at Pazyryk, Siberia, (dating from the end of the 2nd millennium BC), that we found also have tattoos on them. So tattoos were known around the world very early in human history.</p>
    <p>Ancient Egypt and India used tattoos as methods of healing and as methods of religious worship. They were also marks of a status in a society but also a punishment. Tattoos in Philippines were marks of the rank and accomplishments and aspiring edge lords there believed that they have magical properties.</p>

  <h3 id="16">16th Century-Modernity</h3>
  <p>When Christianity appeared, tattooing was considered a barbaric tradition and it slowly faded in Europe to return with transoceanic travels in 16th. Travelers like Sir Martin Frobisher, William Dampier, and Captain James Cook brought home with them indigenous people from places they visited and they were often tattooed. At first, tattooing was “reserved” for sea bois and lower classes but in time, as tattoo artists became more and more proficient, tattooing became hobby of aristocracy which had money to pay high prices of professionals. As the tattooing became cheaper it again was seen as a mark of a lower class. It stayed like that until 1960s and the hippie movement when it slowly entered mainstream changing from deviant behavior to acceptable form of self-expression. It became so mainstream that even Mattel started selling barbie dolls with tattoos. People of both sexes, of all economic classes, and of all ages wear tattoos if they want so. In 2000 15% of Americans had tattoos. Thanks internet, very cool!</p>

     <h1 id="A">Tattoo Facts</h1>
     <li><a>The world record holder in number of tattoos is Gregory Paul McLaren whose skin is 100% covered with tattoos. After him comes Tom Leppard born 1934. His skin is covered with tattoos “only” 99.9%.</a></li>
	<li><a>Hepatitis was a big problem after the Second World War and many places banned tattooing. Some places didn't lift the ban until relatively recently.</a></li>
	<li><a>The most effective way of tattoo removal today is laser removal. Laser breaks large pigment particles into smaller so a body can absorb them and rid of them in a natural way.</a></li>
